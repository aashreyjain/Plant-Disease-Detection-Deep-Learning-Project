# Plant-Disease-Detection-Deep-Learning-Project

Agriculture, a cornerstone of economies worldwide, relies on healthy crop yields. However, factors such as microbial infections and pests can severely impact crops, leading to yield losses and economic strain. Some of the low GDP countries where most of their population is fully dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, disease prevention is crucial. AI and Deep Learning techniques provide a promising approach for automated plant disease identification, offering farmers faster, more accurate diagnoses without manual intervention. This research aims to focus on a CNN-based framework for plant disease detection and survival estimation, aimed at enhancing yield quality and productivity by early and accurate disease detection.
